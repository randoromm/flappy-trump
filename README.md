### Flappy Bird clone ###

This is a parody clone of the game Flappy Bird. This project was heavily rushed and made just for fun. The source code of this game is by no means an example for anyone. It's just bunch of ugly spaghetti code and the game engine has many flaws. Due to rushed pace I didn't manage to get the sound working on Linux, so it only runs on Windows (7+). The game is also kinda sluggish/slowmo-ish because of the flawed game engine. 

The best part about this game is the concept/idea. Basically you flap around with the head of none other than Donald Trump. In the background you can hear a suitable track playing. I made this game after the elections :). No hard feelings for Mr. Trump, this game is only a joke.

I might one day rewrite the engine and organize the code.
